IDEAS FOR FUTURE:

Iniciative roll 
    Each round, order of attackers is decided by random.
    So that, some rounds Player is attacking first, some rounds AI is attacking first. 
    Also, the iniciative rolls can be moddified by Character stats - some are just quicker than others...
    In this case, check on if combatant is living/dead should be after each attack, not at the end of the round 
    otherwise there would be no advantage of being first)
    This will avoid DRAW situations :-)

Multiplayer - human versus human
    Actually, this will be pretty easy now
    
Clever AI
    Computer will have more complex algorithm for deciding what style to choose, depending on his stats and situation.
    
More combatants
    On either side there can be more combatants fighting
    For example two weak orc instead of one mighty character
    Or create real small battles of several combatants
